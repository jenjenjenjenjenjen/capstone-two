      Welcome to NASA API explorer!
    </h1>
    <p>
      NASA provides developers with many APIs to access data about a lot of the work they do. I want to bring this information to everyone, regardless of whether or not they have the knowledge to use the APIs that NASA provides. Here are only the simplest visualizations of the complex data recorded here on Earth as well as on Mars. Happy exploring!
